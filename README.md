This web application is an Online Voting System designed with a comprehensive technology stack, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQLi. The system caters to two distinct user roles: Admin and normal users.

For Admin users, the interface features four main sections: Home, Add Elections, Add Candidate, and Logout. The Home section serves as an overview, while the Add Elections and Add Candidate sections enable the admin to manage the electoral process efficiently. The Logout option ensures secure access control.

Normal users, on the other hand, encounter a simplified interface with two primary sections: Home and Logout. Upon logging in, a normal user gains insight into ongoing elections, facilitating an informed voting decision. Each user is restricted to a single vote, promoting the integrity of the electoral process. After casting their vote, users can seamlessly log out.

The Admin section boasts a critical functionality labeled 'Action.' Here, the admin can explore the election results by clicking the 'View Result' button. This action redirects the admin to a dedicated page, providing a comprehensive display of the voting outcomes, ensuring transparency and accountability in the electoral process.

This Online Voting System offers a seamless experience for both Admin and normal users. The carefully crafted interface and user-specific functionalities enhance accessibility, security, and transparency throughout the voting process.
